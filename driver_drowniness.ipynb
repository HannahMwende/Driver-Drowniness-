        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "The number of people killed and injured in road crashes in Kenya went up by 17.5% in September 2021  as compared to the same period in 2020, according to NTSA. Falling asleep on the wheel is one of the major causes of these accidents. Research has indicated that going more than 20 hours without sleep is the equivalent of having a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.08%.\n",
        "Because of this serious problem, we would like to propose to develop a neural network that can detect if eyes are open or closed and when applied together with computer vision, to detect if a live human has had their eyes closed for more than two seconds.\n",
